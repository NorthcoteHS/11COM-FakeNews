                Fake news is a significant <a href="meme.html" style="text-decoration: none; color: black;">issue</a> in today's society because people are so easily influenced. Every day we see loads of news all around us, and it can be hard to tell what is real and what is not. Many news sites will change stories to make them more interesting, or to draw in consumers, and this can be damaging as it gives us a skewed perception of what is happening in the world.
            <br><br>
                Many people are already proficient at judging the reliability of their news, but many still do not have the knowledge and will accept almost anything they hear. This means all sorts of people can influence us. Politicians, brands, other countries and news companies are all examples of actors in the digital world who can influence our opinions through fake news.
            <br><br>
                Many companies and organisations that have been affected by the rise of digital technology and the internet. Newspaper companies might be tempted to run stories that are either altered or just completely false. Learn more about the stakeholders <a href='info.html' style="color: red;">HERE</a>.
